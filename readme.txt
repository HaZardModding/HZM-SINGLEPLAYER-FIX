HaZardModding Singleplayer Fix for Star Trek Elite Force 2 (2003)

This fixes issues with the Singleplayer that come from overlooked bugs.
There are no gameplay changes and no changes to the Gamecode.
The Idea is to keep the game as it is but cure it from anoying
events that are mostly caused by bugs.

Compatibility
==================================
+ Compatible with both, the offical 1.1 and gog relase.
+ Compatible with your Savegames.
- Might not be fully compatible with Mods that change Level Scripts.
- Might not be fully compatible with Mods that change Menus.


Changes/Fixes - Version 1.00
==================================
- Reduced (400->40) kockback of Alien Commander from Mission 11 to prevent
players getting killed by fall damage rather than the actual
projectile damage.
