m8l1a-drull_ruins has no fog but m8l1b does, so does it need a waitforplayer ?

	$sky.rendereffects( "+skyorigin" );
	$world.entity_fade_dist( 20000 );
	$world.farplane_color ( '0.1 0.11 0.1' );
	$world.farplane ( 4000 );
	$starDome.hide();
	//--- release the cinematic
	noncinematic();
	clearletterbox( .1 );
	releaseplayer();
	cueplayer();
	wait( .5 );
	cam_fadein( .5, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0 );
m8l1b
	$sky.rendereffects( "+skyorigin" );
	$world.weather( "rain", 400 );
	$world.entity_fade_dist( 10000 );
	$world.farplane_color ( '0.1 0.12 0.1' );
	$world.farplane ( 3200 );


Infotexts/hud could be added to give player guidance on dificult sequences like:
1. Final Boss first sequence fight with the Shielded Control Room, as people often don't figure that one out.
2. Mission 6 Engineering, maybe show a warning hud when player destroys components of the ship
3. Mission 6 Exterioor, maybe show a message when player fires to much on the small ships that keep on respawning
