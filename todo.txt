Infotexts/hud could be added to give player guidance on dificult sequences like:
1. Final Boss first sequence fight with the Shielded Control Room, as people often don't figure that one out.
2. Mission 6 Engineering, maybe show a warning hud when player destroys components of the ship
3. Mission 6 Exterioor, maybe show a message when player fires to much on the small ships that keep on respawning
